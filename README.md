# Objectives

Clean and preprocess customer data

Engineer useful features

Perform clustering to group customers

Evaluate optimal number of clusters

Analyze and characterize each customer segment

# Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Removed irrelevant columns

Cleaned dataset

2. Feature Engineering

Created derived features

Dropped unnecessary attributes

3. Visualization & Analysis

Generated correlation heatmap

Explored distributions

Studied customer behavior

4. Encoding

Converted categorical data into numeric format.

5. Scaling

Normalized features to improve clustering performance.

6. Optimal K Selection

Used:

Elbow Method

Silhouette Score

7. Clustering

Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers.

8. Cluster Characterization

# Cluster Insights

## Cluster 0 — Low Income Regular Buyers

Moderate store purchases

Low total spending

Frequent web visits

Budget-conscious customers

## Cluster 1 — High Income Heavy Spenders

High store and catalog purchases

High total spending

Fewer web visits

Loyal premium customers

## Cluster 2 — Low Spending Occasional Buyers

Lowest spending group

Lower purchases overall

High browsing but low buying

## Cluster 3 — Premium Loyal Customers

Very high spending

High campaign response

Strong purchasing frequency

Best target for retention campaigns
